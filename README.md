# Ramen-ratings paper
# 1.Introduction

This paper will discuss on Ramen ratings from The Ramen Rater website from Kaggle. Ramen is without arguing a popular 'fast food' not only in Japan but in many western countries as well but what differs between the many brands available what makes a certain type of ramen better than others, what features have the largest effect on the rating of the product, is it the company that produces the ramen? 

Thus we list 4 questions for when we exploring the dataset clearly:
* 1.What is the most popular kind of ramen noodles?
* 2.What are the top 3 countries which have high average ramen ratings?
* 3.Do the styles of ramen noodles have any impact on the ratings? 
* 4.Do countries have a big impact on the ratings?

Based on above questions, we would like to apply hypothesis testing and simple linear 
regression model to answer these questions.

Data describing Ramen and opinions about it can be found on a website dedicated to this issue - theramenrater.com. We have information about almost 2600 ready-made ramen, which we can buy in various places around the world. Today we'll look at these dishes depending on the continent they come from. The variable about the continent cannot be found in the database, but it can be created based on information about the country of origin, which we group into continents.
